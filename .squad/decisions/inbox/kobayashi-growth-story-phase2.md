### 2026-07-25: Growth Story AI — Production Hardening Pattern
**By:** Kobayashi (AI Agent Engineer)
**Category:** AI Integration, Reliability, Error Handling
**Status:** Implemented (PR #16)

**What:** Established the production hardening pattern for Copilot SDK services:
1. SDK service returns `None` on failure (timeout, SDK error, malformed JSON, schema validation failure) instead of raising exceptions
2. Endpoint handles fallback — reuses existing template-based synthesis endpoint
3. Every response carries `source` field ("ai" | "template") and `analysis_duration_seconds`
4. Schema validation gate: AI output is checked for required keys before acceptance
5. Retry strategy: on malformed JSON, retry once with a simplified prompt; if retry also fails, fall back to template

**Why:** The original implementation raised exceptions on any SDK failure, which caused 502/504 errors in the UI. For a personal trading app, a degraded-but-functional response (template) is always better than a broken endpoint. The `source` field lets the frontend show appropriate confidence indicators.

**Design decisions:**
1. **None-return pattern over exceptions** — The service handles its own retry/timeout internally and returns `None` to signal "I couldn't do it." This keeps the endpoint simple and testable.
2. **120s retry timeout (vs 180s initial)** — The retry prompt is simpler and shouldn't need as long. Total worst-case wall time is ~300s, but the 180s initial timeout covers 95% of cases.
3. **Schema validation is structural only** — We check that keys exist and are the right type, but don't validate content quality. Content quality is the agent prompt's job.
4. **Agent prompt strengthened** — Added explicit required-fields table, noise filter rules, source weighting priority table. This reduces malformed JSON occurrences at the source.

**Impact:** No breaking changes. The endpoint never crashes on SDK failures now. Template fallback provides consistent UX. This pattern should be replicated for any future SDK-powered endpoints.
