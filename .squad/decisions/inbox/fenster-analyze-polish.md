# Decision: Analyze Page — Shared Components & Error Resilience

**Author:** Fenster (Frontend)
**Date:** 2025-07-24
**Issue:** #6 — Company Analysis polish for v0.0.1

## Context

The Analyze page had duplicated skeleton/error UI across ShortTermView and LongTermView, no per-section error isolation, no retry support in shortterm hooks, and rigid grid layouts on mobile.

## Decisions

1. **Extracted `shared/` component library** — SkeletonCard, ErrorBanner (with optional `onRetry`), SectionErrorBoundary (React class error boundary), and EmptyState live under `Analyze/shared/` with a barrel export. Both views now import from this single source.

2. **Per-section error boundaries** — Every data-driven section in both views is wrapped in `<SectionErrorBoundary>`. A crash in one section (e.g. chart rendering) no longer takes down the entire page.

3. **Retry on all hooks** — All 4 shortterm hooks (`useTechnicals`, `usePriceHistory`, `useSynthesis`, `useOptionChain`) now expose `refetch` via `useCallback`. Longterm hooks already had this. Each section's ErrorBanner wires to the relevant hook's `refetch`.

4. **Mobile-responsive grids** — FinancialScorecard changed from `grid-cols-2` to `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2`. ShortTermView grids changed from `md:grid-cols-2` to `sm:grid-cols-2` for earlier breakpoint.

5. **Improved empty & error states** — No-ticker-selected now shows an EmptyState with suggestions. Invalid-ticker errors show a descriptive message with icon and retry button.

## Trade-offs

- SectionErrorBoundary is a class component (React requirement for error boundaries). This is the only class component in the codebase.
- The `shared/` folder is scoped to Analyze. If other pages need these components later, they can be promoted to a top-level `shared/` or `ui/` directory.
