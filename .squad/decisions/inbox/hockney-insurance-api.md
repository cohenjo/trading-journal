# Decision: Insurance Policies API Design

**Date:** 2025-07-22
**Author:** Hockney (Backend Dev)
**Issue:** #18

## Context

Insurance policies page needs a backend API. This is a new standalone entity, not embedded in the finance snapshots system like pensions.

## Decisions

1. **Standalone table, not snapshot-embedded**: Insurance policies are CRUD entities stored in their own `insurance_policies` table with UUID PKs. Unlike pensions (which live inside `FinanceSnapshot.data` as JSON items), insurance policies don't need time-series tracking or net-worth calculations. They're reference data.

2. **sum_insured as string**: Kept as free-text (`str`) instead of `float` because coverage descriptions vary — some are monetary ("₪2,000,000"), some are descriptive ("Covers remaining mortgage balance"). Frontend can display as-is.

3. **Owner values: "You" / "Partner"**: Matches the existing pension pattern for household-level ownership.

4. **Type enum validated server-side**: Accepted values are `life`, `mortgage`, `health`, `disability`, `other`. Validated in the API layer, not at the DB level, so the enum can be extended without migrations.

## Impact

- Frontend team: API is at `/api/insurance` with standard CRUD + `?owner=` filter
- No impact on existing finance/pension systems
- Migration `acadd4bc6806` needs to run on deploy
