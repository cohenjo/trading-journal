## Active Architectural Directives

### Insurance/household scoping: `is_household_member()` (read) + `is_household_writer()` (write) — `user_id` columns removed (2026-05-12)

Canonical write-scoping pattern for household-scoped tables. The `insurance_policies` table removed the `user_id` column entirely after wave2 cleanup (PR #379), enforcing `household_id NOT NULL` with RLS policies using the shared `is_household_member()`/`is_household_writer()` functions. This pattern is now the standard for all household-scoped data access control — both frontend (PostgREST + cookie-based RLS) and backend (service-role direct DB). All SELECT policies use `is_household_member(household_id)` within a `SECURITY DEFINER` context; write operations (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) use `is_household_writer(household_id)` to enforce role-based authorization (owner/member).

**References:** PR [#379](https://github.com/cohenjo/trading-journal/pull/379), migration `20260501120000_align_insurance_policies_household_id`, issue [#335](https://github.com/cohenjo/trading-journal/issues/335) Step 5

---

### RLS policies via `is_household_member(household_id)` SECURITY DEFINER function (2026-05-11)

All household-scoped tables use a common RLS pattern: SELECT policies that JOIN through a bridging table (e.g., `trading_account_config`) with a `WHERE is_household_member(household_id)` predicate. The `is_household_member()` function is a SECURITY DEFINER stored procedure that evaluates the authenticated session's household membership. Examples: `stock_positions`, `dividend_payments`, `dividend_accruals` all follow this pattern. Global reference tables (e.g., `security_reference`) disable RLS entirely. No INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE policies are needed for tables updated exclusively by backend workers using service-role direct DB connections. This pattern ensures frontend (PostgREST + cookie-based auth) and backend (service role) have aligned security boundaries.

**References:** PR [#375](https://github.com/cohenjo/trading-journal/pull/375), migration `20260511102251_add_rls_policies_dividend_disable_security_reference`, issue [#374](https://github.com/cohenjo/trading-journal/issues/374)

---

### Positions as Source of Truth (2026-05-11)

The accounts page mirrors the user's broker positions (synced via Flex Query, CSV, manual entry, or any other ingestion path). The Bonds page and Dividends page are FILTERED, PRODUCT-SPECIFIC VIEWS over those same positions, not independent data stores. The Dividends page displays all dividend-bearing positions held across all configured accounts, enriched with dividend metrics (TTM yield, expected/forward yield). Dividend payments and bond income are PROJECTED from positions — not independently maintained. All future work on `/trading/accounts`, `/dividends`, and `/bonds` must follow this pattern.

## Decision Log

### 2026-05-12: A11y & Test Alignment — htmlFor + LadderPage coupon test (#372, #376)

**By:** Fenster (Frontend Dev)
**PR:** [#378](https://github.com/cohenjo/trading-journal/pull/378) — `fix(a11y, tests): label htmlFor + LadderPage coupon test alignment (#372, #376)`
**Issues closed:** [#372](https://github.com/cohenjo/trading-journal/issues/372), [#376](https://github.com/cohenjo/trading-journal/issues/376)

**What:** Batched two small frontend fixes: (1) Added `htmlFor`/`id` attributes to TradingAccountSettings form labels (9 pairs) to resolve test accessibility issues and improve semantic HTML. (2) Updated LadderPage coupon test expectation to match new `displayCouponRate` utility default. Combined both into a single commit per best practice for logical, focused batching.

**Why:** #372 (htmlFor) was flagged by Redfoot during PR #371 LURVG validation — the `getByLabel()` test utility timed out due to missing `htmlFor` attributes on label elements. #376 was the pre-existing LadderPage test failure (518/519 baseline). Batching both fixes reduces git history fragmentation while maintaining clarity of purpose.

**Test results:** 519/519 passing post-merge ✅. No regressions in other routes. No backend or shared interface changes — isolated frontend-only fix.

### 2026-05-12: Insurance Wave2 Cleanup — `user_id` Dropped, `household_id` NOT NULL (#335 Step 5)

**By:** Hockney (Backend Dev)
**PR:** [#379](https://github.com/cohenjo/trading-journal/pull/379) — `chore(insurance): drop user_id, require household_id (#335 Step 5)`
**Issue:** [#335](https://github.com/cohenjo/trading-journal/issues/335) Step 5
**Migration:** `20260501120000_align_insurance_policies_household_id` (applied to prod 2026-05-12)

**What:** Applied deferred `insurance_policies` cleanup migration that removes the legacy `user_id` column entirely, enforces `household_id NOT NULL`, and replaces all 8 pre-wave2 RLS policies with 4 canonical household-scoped policies using `is_household_member()`/`is_household_writer()` SECURITY DEFINER pattern. Pre-flight backfill included a **Step 2b fallback** that looks up `household_members` for users with null `user_profile.default_household_id`, preserving 2 test rows that would have been deleted as orphans.

**Why:** Wave2 cleanup is the final step to retire the legacy `user_id` scoping pattern from the `insurance_policies` table. The canonical household-scoped pattern (read via `is_household_member()`, write via `is_household_writer()`) is now the standard across all household-scoped tables. No frontend or backend code changes required — all queries already use `household_id` exclusively (verified in `apps/frontend/src/app/insurance/actions.ts` and `insurance_models.py`).

**Tests & validation:** 519/519 unit tests passing. Playwright smoke (3/3): `/insurance` route renders without error, no `user_id` column references in server response, Add Policy flow functional. Redfoot LURVG approved 🟢 (see separate decision below).

**Key learning:** When backfilling `household_id` from `user_id`, include a `household_members` fallback for users with null `user_profile.default_household_id`. Standard backfill patterns (using only `user_profile.default_household_id`) silently drop orphan rows.

---

### 2026-05-12: Insurance Wave2 Cleanup LURVG Approved — Redfoot Validation (#379)

**By:** Redfoot (Tester)
**PR:** [#379](https://github.com/cohenjo/trading-journal/pull/379) — `chore(insurance): drop user_id, require household_id (#335 Step 5)`
**Validation date:** 2026-05-11
**Verdict:** 🟢 APPROVED — ready to squash-merge

**What:** Comprehensive LURVG validation of PR #379 migration. Schema verified via Supabase MCP: `user_id` column absent, `household_id` NOT NULL (uuid type), 2 test rows preserved with correct backfill, 4 canonical RLS policies present (`insurance_policies_select/insert/update/delete` using `is_household_member()`/`is_household_writer()`), all 8 pre-wave2 `_own` policies removed. Unit tests 519/519 passing. UI smoke tests 3/3: `/insurance` renders clean, no `user_id` errors, Add Policy CTA visible, household-scoped RLS functional.

**Why:** LURVG protocol requires comprehensive schema, unit test, and UI validation before code merge. The migration was already applied to prod; this validation confirms the migration is correct and safe as the source-of-truth commit.

**Key learning:** When a user has `household_members` rows but no `user_profile.default_household_id`, standard backfill patterns fail silently. The enhanced migration in PR #379 includes a `household_members` fallback that preserves these rows. Additionally, `trg_households_add_creator` auto-inserts creator as owner in `household_members` — never insert manually or duplicate key violation occurs. The `is_household_writer` function maps to role IN ('owner', 'member') — both satisfy write RLS.

### 2026-05-12: Migration Drift Repair — Track 6 Ad-Hoc Migrations (#335 Steps 1–2)

**By:** Kujan (DevOps/Platform)
**PR:** [#377](https://github.com/cohenjo/trading-journal/pull/377) — `chore(migrations): track ad-hoc applied migrations (#335 Steps 1-2)`
**Issue:** [#335](https://github.com/cohenjo/trading-journal/issues/335) Steps 1–2
**Migrations tracked (tracking-only — no DDL re-run):**

| Version | Name |
|---------|------|
| 20260510000100 | extend_stock_positions_flex_fields |
| 20260510000200 | flex_bond_holdings_snapshot |
| 20260510000300 | dividend_payments |
| 20260510000400 | dividend_accruals |
| 20260510000500 | security_reference |
| 20260511052500 | backfill_placeholder_account_households |

**What:** Executed the drift audit's Steps 1–2: inserted 6 tracking rows into `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` for migrations that were applied ad-hoc to prod on 2026-05-10/11 (during Flex pipeline Phase 1) but had no corresponding tracking table entries. All DDL was verified present in prod before inserting rows; no DDL was re-executed. Used `ON CONFLICT (version) DO NOTHING` to make the script idempotent. Saved runbook to `supabase/scripts/track-adhoc-migrations.sql`.

**Why:** Flex pipeline Phase 1 DDL was applied directly to prod outside the Supabase CLI migration flow. The tracking table had no rows for these versions, causing `supabase db push` to attempt re-runs, which would fail on the non-idempotent `ADD CONSTRAINT` in migration 000200. Tracking these versions prevents re-execution attempts and unblocks subsequent audit steps.

**Handoff:** Kujan's work unblocks Hockney to proceed with Steps 3–4 (RLS policies, see PR #375) and Step 5 (insurance_policies cleanup, see PR #379). Hockney can now safely run `supabase db push` without triggering re-runs of these 6 ad-hoc migrations.

### 2026-05-12: RLS Fix — Dividend Tables + security_reference (#375, #374)

**By:** Redfoot (Tester) — Validation
**By:** Hockney (Backend Dev) — Implementation
**PR:** [#375](https://github.com/cohenjo/trading-journal/pull/375) — `fix(security): add RLS policies for dividend tables, disable RLS on security_reference (#374)`
**Issues closed:** [#374](https://github.com/cohenjo/trading-journal/issues/374)
**Migration:** `20260511102251_add_rls_policies_dividend_disable_security_reference` (applied to prod 2026-05-11)

**What:** 2-part fix resolving RLS silent-deny-all on 3 tables:
1. **`dividend_payments` + `dividend_accruals`** — Added household-scoped SELECT policies via canonical pattern: `account_id IN (SELECT account_id FROM trading_account_config WHERE is_household_member(household_id))`. Mirrors pattern used by `stock_positions` and `trading_account_config` itself.
2. **`security_reference`** — Global reference table (ticker → company name, sector, etc.), no per-household data. Disabled RLS entirely (semantically correct, avoids misleading USING(true) policy). Service role writes only; all authenticated users may read.
3. **Removed admin-client workaround** — `getDividendPositions()` now uses standard `createClient()` (cookie-based, RLS-gated) instead of `createAdminClient()` bypass.

**Why:** RLS was enabled on all 3 tables but zero policies existed → silent deny-all for PostgREST clients. `dividend_payments`/`dividend_accruals` had been hidden behind admin-client workaround (PR #368). The new RLS policies provide proper scoped access; `security_reference` fix unblocks future parsers that read via `createClient()`.

**Tests:** 518/519 passing (1 pre-existing LadderPage coupon_rate formatting failure, unrelated). Playwright LURVG (5/5 tests):
- `/dividends` IBKR — table populated (JEPI, O, GS) via standard client ✅
- `/dividends` Schwab — correct empty state ✅
- `/ladder` IBKR — bonds populated, no regression ✅
- `/summary` — loads, no regression ✅
- `/trading/accounts` — 3 tabs visible, no regression ✅

**Key learning (RLS seed strategy):** When RLS joins `dividend_payments.account_id → trading_account_config.account_id`, seed with the REAL broker account number (e.g. `U2515365`), not a fake UUID. Using fake IDs causes RLS join to return 0 rows → test shows empty state (visually correct but semantically wrong). Always pair with `household_id` filter to avoid `.single()` failures on duplicate account_ids.

**Verdict:** 🟢 APPROVED (Redfoot LURVG validation). Safe to merge.

### 2026-05-12: Broker-Form Fix Validated — LURVG Closure (#371 + #359)

**By:** Redfoot (Tester)
**PR:** [#371](https://github.com/cohenjo/trading-journal/pull/371) — `fix(settings): normalize account_type to lowercase + surface save errors`
**Issue:** [#359](https://github.com/cohenjo/trading-journal/issues/359)
**Verdict:** 🟢 APPROVED

**What:** LURVG validation confirms Hockney's fix for the broker-account form. Pre-fix bug reproduced on main: adding a duplicate account type silently succeeds (no duplicate-prevention check). Post-fix validation passes: second Schwab add now rejected with "already configured" error; all DOM assertions pass (tabs visible, error/success banners functional). Spec issue identified: `getByLabel` timeout in `add-broker-form.spec.ts` due to missing `htmlFor` attribute on label element; Redfoot applied fix (`getByTitle()` instead). Smoke tests pass (3/3).

**Why:** LURVG protocol requires test reproduction before & validation after to confirm fix resolves the issue without introducing regressions. Pre-fix reproduction verified the silent-duplicate bug existed on main. Post-fix validation confirmed the fix works and doesn't break other routes.

**Follow-ups (deferred):** Add `htmlFor`/`id` pairing to `TradingAccountSettings.tsx` labels (Fenster domain) so `getByLabel` works in future specs.

---

### 2026-05-12: Settings Form Fix — Broker-Account Normalization + Duplicate Prevention (#371, #359)

**By:** Hockney (Backend Dev)
**PR:** [#371](https://github.com/cohenjo/trading-journal/pull/371) — `fix(settings): normalize account_type to lowercase + surface save errors`
**Issue closed:** [#359](https://github.com/cohenjo/trading-journal/issues/359)

**What:** Implemented 3-layer fix to the Settings "Add Broker" form: (1) Frontend testid hardening (`account-tab-{type}`), (2) Backend `normalizeAccountType()` utility in `src/lib/trading/account-type.ts` (sync helper, must live in `lib/` not `'use server'` files per Next.js 15 rules), (3) Backend duplicate-check via RLS-scoped SELECT before INSERT + friendly error surface. Root cause: DB constraint `chk_account_type` requires lowercase; no validator existed for uppercase inputs; no duplicate-prevention check existed.

**Why:** Form was silently failing on broker adds. Users submitted uppercase account types (from partial prior fixes), and re-adding an already-configured account type produced constraint violations swallowed by the backend. The fix enforces lowercase normalization upstream + surfaces errors to the user via `saveError` state and error banner. Tested: 17 unit tests + 2 e2e Playwright specs (all green).

**Follow-ups (deferred):** (1) Clean up `TradingAccountType` union to remove uppercase variants. (2) Normalize `seedOptionsDashboard` to use lowercase account_type. (3) Add `htmlFor`/`id` pairing to label+input in `TradingAccountSettings.tsx` (Fenster domain; Redfoot identified spec limitation during LURVG validation).

### 2026-05-11: Nightly Backup Workflow Hardening + Issue Deduplication (#370, #344–#349)

**By:** Kujan (DevOps/Platform)
**PR:** [#370](https://github.com/cohenjo/trading-journal/pull/370) — `chore(infra): backup workflow hardening + dedupe (#344-#349)`
**Issues closed:** [#344](https://github.com/cohenjo/trading-journal/issues/344), [#345](https://github.com/cohenjo/trading-journal/issues/345), [#346](https://github.com/cohenjo/trading-journal/issues/346), [#347](https://github.com/cohenjo/trading-journal/issues/347), [#348](https://github.com/cohenjo/trading-journal/issues/348), [#349](https://github.com/cohenjo/trading-journal/issues/349)

**What:** Root cause: Commit `870a253` (2026-05-05) added PGDG APT repo but kept installing `postgresql-client-15`. Supabase runs PostgreSQL 17; the workflow's `PG_DUMP` env var pointed to `/usr/lib/postgresql/17/bin/pg_dump`, which didn't exist, causing every nightly cron run to fail immediately (2026-05-05 onward). Fix already merged (commits `04d3558`, `fa6b75c`, `1e9e011`): bumped to `postgresql-client-17`, set explicit `PG_DUMP` path. Last successful backup verified: run [25654224589](https://github.com/cohenjo/trading-journal/actions/runs/25654224589) (2026-05-11T06:35:26Z). Backup hardening (this PR): `alert-on-failure` job now deduplicates — searches for open `🚨 Nightly backup FAILED` issues before creating new ones; closes prior issues as "superseded" before opening a single fresh issue.

**Why:** On 2026-05-09, operator manually triggered the workflow 6 times while investigating. The `alert-on-failure` job had no deduplication check, producing 6 near-identical critical GitHub issues (#344–#349) in 31 minutes. Result: repeated failures or manual re-triggers now produce exactly **one open issue** at a time, preventing issue spam and false escalation signals.

**Recommendations:** (1) Document that `postgresql-client-XY` version must match Supabase Postgres major version; add comment to workflow. (2) Implement external health check (healthchecks.io) for backup failures. (3) Upgrade Supabase tier to eliminate free-tier inactivity pauses.

## Executive recommendation

Use **one revised Activity Flex Query** as the operational source for `/trading/accounts`, `/dividends`, and bond ladder ingestion. Do **not** replace it with Trade Confirm Flex, Cash Activity-only reports, or PortfolioAnalyst as the primary feed.

The one important caveat: Activity Flex gives us current bond positions, identifiers, maturity/issue metadata, accrued interest, and cash coupon payments, but it does **not** appear to export bond coupon rate, payment frequency, credit rating, or yield-to-maturity as stable Activity Flex fields. Those should be computed or enriched after ingest, with PortfolioAnalyst Fixed Income used as a manual validation source if Jony wants broker-side fixed-income analytics.

Current `reports/activity/2025.xml` sections found: `AccountInformation`, `CashTransactions`, `EquitySummaryInBase`, `OpenPositions`, `OptionEAE`, `Trades`. It has `OpenPositions` counts of STK=54, OPT=48, BOND=17, and no `ChangeInDividendAccruals` or `OpenDividendAccruals` yet.

---

## 1. Recommended Flex Query Architecture

### Recommend: one comprehensive Activity Flex Query

Create or revise a single **Activity Flex Query** in Client Portal with XML output and these sections:

1. `AccountInformation` — account identity / base currency.
2. `OpenPositions` — current snapshot for STK, BOND, OPT.
3. `FinancialInstrumentInformation` — identifiers and static metadata missing from current `OpenPositions` rows.
4. `CashTransactions` — historical dividends, withholding tax, payment-in-lieu, and bond interest cash flow.
5. `ChangeInDividendAccruals` — declared dividend changes during the report window.
6. `OpenDividendAccruals` — unpaid declared dividends as of report date.
7. `CorporateActions` — optional-but-recommended reconciliation for coupon/maturity/stock-dividend actions.

Keep the existing options sections (`Trades`, `OptionEAE`) in the same Activity Flex if that query is also feeding options income. The key is: **do not remove existing sections Hockney's parser already depends on.**

### Why Activity Flex

| Query type | Fit | Reason |
|---|---:|---|
| Activity Flex Query | ✅ Best | One XML can contain positions, cash transactions, dividend accruals, trades, and instrument reference fields. It is the only simple one-query path. |
| Trade Confirmation Flex | ❌ Not enough | Great for executions, but not current holdings, open dividend accruals, or daily bond ladder snapshots. |
| Cash Activity-only / cash reports | ❌ Not enough | Can cover paid dividends and withholding, but not holdings, market value, maturity, or instrument metadata. |
| PortfolioAnalyst / Fixed Income widget | ⚠️ Validation/enrichment | Good for bond analytics such as average maturity, coupon, duration, credit quality, and projected interest, but not the same stable Flex XML ingestion path. Use later if Flex + enrichment is insufficient. |

### Pros / cons of one query

**Pros**
- One portal template for Jony to maintain.
- One Flex Web Service query ID for the worker.
- Same account/date boundaries across positions, cash, and accruals.
- Fewer reconciliation bugs between independently timed reports.

**Cons**
- The XML is larger.
- Parser must route rows carefully by section and `assetCategory`.
- Tax-lot detail should not be mixed into aggregate `stock_positions` unless we add a lot table and grouping rules.

**Recommendation:** one Activity Flex query now; add a separate tax-lot or PortfolioAnalyst export only if a later requirement truly needs first-lot date, coupon schedule validation, duration, or broker-sourced credit quality.

---

## 2. Stocks — positions snapshot

### Section

Use `<OpenPositions>` with `assetCategory='STK'`, `putCall=''`, **Level of Detail = Summary** for the accounts UI.

Also enable `<FinancialInstrumentInformation>` for STK identifiers and listing exchange.

### Required stock fields and rationale

| Field | Flex source | App mapping | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| Account ID | `OpenPositions.accountId` | lookup to `trading_account_config.account_id`; stored as `stock_positions.account_id` internal FK | Separates IBKR, Schwab, IRA tabs and supports latest snapshot per account. |
| Asset Class / Category | `assetCategory` | new `stock_positions.asset_category` optional; raw payload currently | Guards parser so only STK rows populate stocks. |
| Symbol | `symbol` | `stock_positions.ticker` | Primary UI ticker. |
| Underlying Symbol | `underlyingSymbol` | optional `stock_positions.underlying_symbol` or raw payload | IBKR often duplicates symbol for STK; useful for normalization checks. |
| Conid | `conid` | `stock_positions.con_id` | Stable broker instrument key; better than ticker for renamed/dual-listed securities. |
| Description | `description` | `stock_positions.description` | Human-readable security name in accounts UI. |
| Currency | `currency` | `stock_positions.currency` | Needed for multi-currency market value and dividend calculations. |
| Subcategory | `subCategory` | `stock_positions.sub_category` | COMMON / ETF / REIT / PREFERENCE grouping. |
| Quantity | `position` | `stock_positions.quantity` | Source-of-truth shares; replaces trade-derived quantity. |
| Multiplier | `multiplier` | new `stock_positions.multiplier` optional; raw payload currently | Usually 1 for STK; useful guard against bad math. |
| Mark Price | `markPrice` | `stock_positions.mark_price` | Current price shown on accounts page. |
| Position Value | `positionValue` | `stock_positions.market_value` | Current market value; avoids recomputing from rounded prices. |
| Cost Basis Price | `costBasisPrice` | `stock_positions.cost_basis` | Per-share average cost. |
| Cost Basis Money | `costBasisMoney` | **new** `stock_positions.cost_basis_total` | Total cost basis; current schema does not persist it even though parser extracts it. |
| FIFO Unrealized PNL | `fifoPnlUnrealized` | `stock_positions.unrealized_pnl` | Accounts page P&L. |
| Report Date | `reportDate` if enabled, else statement end date | `stock_positions.as_of_date` | Idempotent daily snapshot key. Current parser falls back to statement end date. |
| Listing Exchange | `FinancialInstrumentInformation.listingExchange` | **new** `stock_positions.listing_exchange` or `security_reference.listing_exchange` | Useful for ADR/local listing disambiguation. Not in current OpenPositions XML. |
| Security ID / Type | `securityID`, `securityIDType` | **new** `security_reference.security_id`, `.security_id_type` | Broker identifier crosswalk. |
| CUSIP / ISIN / FIGI | `cusip`, `isin`, `figi` | **new** `security_reference` fields; optionally denormalize to stock_positions | Helps reconcile ticker changes and non-US holdings. |
| Dividend yield | not Activity Flex | `dividend_ticker_data.dividend_yield` | Compute / lookup from market data; do not store on position snapshots. |
| Sector / Industry | not Activity Flex | **new** `dividend_ticker_data.sector`, `.industry` or `security_reference` | Enrichment source, not IBKR Activity Flex. |

### First-buy / tax-lot date

The current Activity Flex `OpenPositions` summary rows have `openDateTime=''` for STK. IBKR's Activity Flex reference exposes **Open Date Time** inside `OpenPositions`, but it is meaningful when the section is configured at **Lot** detail, not aggregate Summary detail. I did not find a separate `<OpenPositionsTaxLot>` Activity Flex section in the reference; the likely path is `OpenPositions` with Level of Detail = Lot.

Do **not** enable lot detail for the same table unless the parser aggregates lots before writing `stock_positions`; otherwise we will re-create the duplicate-row problem. If first-buy/holding-period matters, add a separate `stock_position_lots` table or derive earliest buy from `Trades`.

---

## 3. Bonds — positions + maturity + yield

### Sections

Use `<OpenPositions>` filtered by `assetCategory='BOND'`, plus `<FinancialInstrumentInformation>` for identifier and maturity metadata.

I did **not** find a dedicated `<BondPosition>` section in the Activity Flex reference. Bond-specific analytics such as coupon, payment frequency, ratings, duration, and broker yield are visible in TWS/PortfolioAnalyst surfaces, but they are not listed as Activity Flex `OpenPositions` fields.

### Required bond fields and rationale

| Field | Flex source | App mapping | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| Account ID | `OpenPositions.accountId` | **new** `bond_holdings.account_id` | Bond ladder needs account scoping like stocks/options. |
| Asset Class | `assetCategory='BOND'` | **new** `bond_holdings.asset_category` or raw payload | Parser discriminator. |
| Symbol | `symbol` | `bond_holdings.ticker` | IBKR bond symbol / display key. |
| Description | `description` | **new** `bond_holdings.description`; can seed issuer parsing | Human-readable bond name. |
| Conid | `conid` | **new** `bond_holdings.con_id` | Stable IBKR instrument key; needed when CUSIP is absent. |
| Security ID / Type | Financial Instrument Information | **new** `bond_holdings.security_id`, `.security_id_type` | Identifier crosswalk. |
| CUSIP / ISIN / FIGI | Financial Instrument Information | **new** `bond_holdings.cusip`, `.isin`, `.figi` | Bond identity and matching across sources. |
| Face Value | `OpenPositions.position` | `bond_holdings.face_value` | For bonds, IBKR position is face amount. |
| Currency | `currency` | `bond_holdings.currency` | Coupon and market-value currency. |
| Subcategory | `subCategory` | **new** `bond_holdings.sub_category` | Corp / Govt / Muni style grouping; current sample shows Corp. |
| Mark Price | `markPrice` | **new** `bond_holdings.mark_price` | Bond price as percent-of-par-style mark. |
| Market Value | `positionValue` | **new** `bond_holdings.market_value` | Accounts UI and allocation. |
| Cost Basis Price | `costBasisPrice` | **new** `bond_holdings.cost_basis_price` | Average acquisition price. |
| Cost Basis Money | `costBasisMoney` | **new** `bond_holdings.cost_basis_total` | Total cost basis. |
| FIFO Unrealized PNL | `fifoPnlUnrealized` | **new** `bond_holdings.unrealized_pnl` | Bond P&L. |
| Accrued Interest | `accruedInterest` if enabled | **new** `bond_holdings.accrued_interest` | Needed for clean/dirty value and income accrual. Current XML does not include this field; enable it. |
| Issuer | Financial Instrument Information `issuer` if present | `bond_holdings.issuer` | Ladder display and credit concentration. |
| Issue Date | Financial Instrument Information `issueDate` | `bond_holdings.issue_date` | Static bond metadata; current table requires it. |
| Maturity Date | Financial Instrument Information `maturity` | `bond_holdings.maturity_date` | Core ladder bucket. |
| Coupon Rate | not Activity Flex in found reference | existing `bond_holdings.coupon_rate`, but should become nullable/enriched | Needed for projected coupon income. Populate by enrichment/manual until broker export is confirmed. |
| Coupon Frequency | not Activity Flex in found reference | existing `bond_holdings.coupon_frequency`, should become nullable/enriched | Needed for monthly/annual coupon schedule. |
| Yield to Maturity / Mark Yield | not Activity Flex in found reference | **new** `bond_holdings.yield_to_maturity` or computed view | Compute from coupon, maturity, market price; do not assume Flex provides it. |
| Credit Rating | not Activity Flex in found reference | **new** `bond_holdings.credit_rating` or enrichment table | PortfolioAnalyst/TWS may show ratings; Activity Flex reference did not. |
| Report Date | `reportDate` or statement end date | **new** `bond_holdings.as_of_date` | Snapshot idempotency. |
| Raw Payload | row attrs | **new** `bond_holdings.raw_payload` | Audit/debug for bond mismatch. |

### Current production table status

Prod has `public.bond_holdings`, from applied migration `20260503142433_add_bond_holdings`. The older local `20260501040000_wave2b_holdings_dividends_db.sql` is **not** listed in prod migrations, but its bond table concept was superseded by the applied `add_bond_holdings` migration.

Current prod `bond_holdings` is manual/ladder-shaped only: `household_id`, `id`, `ticker`, `issuer`, `currency`, `face_value`, `coupon_rate`, `coupon_frequency`, `issue_date`, `maturity_date`, timestamps, `deleted_at`. It is not ready for Flex snapshots without columns above.

## 4. Dividends — income + yield projection

### Sections

Enable all three dividend-related paths:

1. `<CashTransactions>` filtered by `type in ('Dividends', 'Payment In Lieu Of Dividends', 'Withholding Tax')` for historical paid income and taxes.
2. `<ChangeInDividendAccruals>` for declared dividend accrual changes during the report period.
3. `<OpenDividendAccruals>` for accrued/unpaid dividends as of report date.

Also keep bond income types from `CashTransactions`: `Bond Interest Received` and `Bond Interest Paid`.

### Dividend field mapping and rationale

| Field | Flex source | App mapping | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| Account ID | all dividend sections | `dividend_payments.account_id`; `dividend_accruals.account_id` | Per-account income reporting. |
| Symbol | all dividend sections | `dividend_payments.ticker`; `dividend_accruals.ticker` | Ticker-level income and projections. |
| Conid | all dividend sections | `dividend_payments.con_id`; `dividend_accruals.con_id` | Stable identity for ticker changes / dual listings. |
| Description | all dividend sections | description fields | Useful for audit and matching withholding rows. |
| Currency | all dividend sections | currency fields | Needed for multi-currency income. |
| Date/Time | `CashTransactions.dateTime` | `dividend_payments.event_time` | Historical posting timestamp. |
| Report Date | `reportDate` | `dividend_payments.report_date`; `dividend_accruals.report_date` | Statement reconciliation. |
| Settle Date | `settleDate` if available | `dividend_payments.settle_date` | Cash settlement date. |
| Cash Type | `CashTransactions.type` | `dividend_payments.payment_type` | Distinguish dividends, PIL, withholding, bond interest. |
| Amount | `CashTransactions.amount` | `dividend_payments.raw_amount`, gross/tax/net derived | Paid cash amount. Withholding is usually negative and separate. |
| Trade ID / Transaction ID / Action ID | cash identifiers | `dividend_payments.source_transaction_id`, `.trade_id`, `.action_id` | Idempotency and grouping gross/tax rows. |
| Ex Date | dividend accrual sections | `dividend_accruals.ex_date` | Projection timing and eligibility. |
| Pay Date | dividend accrual sections | `dividend_accruals.pay_date` | Upcoming cash-flow schedule. |
| Quantity | dividend accrual sections | `dividend_accruals.quantity` | Shares eligible for declared dividend. |
| Gross Rate | dividend accrual sections | `dividend_accruals.gross_rate` | Dividend per share; this is the upcoming `gross_dividend_per_share`. |
| Gross Amount | dividend accrual sections | `dividend_accruals.gross_amount` | Declared gross cash expected. |
| Tax | dividend accrual sections | `dividend_accruals.tax` | Expected withholding. |
| Fee | dividend accrual sections | `dividend_accruals.fee` | Fees on dividend event if any. |
| Net Amount | dividend accrual sections | `dividend_accruals.net_amount` | Expected net cash. |
| Code | dividend accrual sections | `dividend_accruals.code` | Posting/reversal/open semantics. |
| FromAcct / ToAcct | dividend accrual sections | optional raw/enrichment columns | Rare but useful for transfer reconciliation. |

### Yield projection note

Dividend yield is **computed**, not exported by Activity Flex. For current yield, continue using `dividend_ticker_data.dividend_yield` / `dividend_rate` populated by market-data enrichment. For declared upcoming payments, `OpenDividendAccruals.grossRate` gives the cash-per-share for that event; annualized yield still needs current price.

### `dividend_payments` status

Prod does **not** have `dividend_payments` or `dividend_accruals`. Prod does have `dividend_ticker_data`, `dividend_estimations`, and the legacy `dividend_positions` table.

## 6. Schema deltas required before ingesting the new XML

### `stock_positions`

Exists in prod via `20260509180919_add_stock_positions`. Add:

- `cost_basis_total numeric(18,4)` — parser already extracts `costBasisMoney`, schema does not persist it.
- `listing_exchange text` — from `FinancialInstrumentInformation`.
- `security_id text`, `security_id_type text`, `cusip text`, `isin text`, `figi text` — or put these in a new `security_reference` table keyed by `con_id`.
- Optional: `asset_category text`, `underlying_symbol text`, `multiplier numeric(18,6)`, `percent_of_nav numeric(18,6)`.
- Do **not** add dividend yield to `stock_positions`; join to `dividend_ticker_data`.
- Do **not** add sector/industry from Flex; enrich `dividend_ticker_data` or a new `security_reference` table.

### `bond_holdings`

Exists in prod via `20260503142433_add_bond_holdings`. It needs to become Flex-snapshot-capable:

- Add account/snapshot fields: `account_id integer`, `as_of_date date`, `source text`, `last_broker_sync_at timestamptz`, `raw_payload jsonb`.
- Add identifiers: `con_id integer`, `security_id text`, `security_id_type text`, `cusip text`, `isin text`, `figi text`.
- Add valuation fields: `description text`, `sub_category text`, `mark_price numeric`, `market_value numeric`, `cost_basis_price numeric`, `cost_basis_total numeric`, `unrealized_pnl numeric`, `accrued_interest numeric`.
- Add analytics placeholders: `yield_to_maturity numeric`, `credit_rating text`, `coupon_source text`, `yield_source text`.
- Relax `coupon_rate`, `coupon_frequency`, `issue_date`, and possibly `maturity_date` to nullable until Financial Instrument Information/enrichment is wired. Current NOT NULL constraints will block ingest if IBKR omits any field.
- Add partial unique index for Flex snapshots: `(account_id, con_id, as_of_date) where source='flex'`, with fallback using `(account_id, coalesce(cusip, isin, id), as_of_date)` if conid is absent.

### `dividend_payments`

Does **not** exist in prod. Create it before parsing paid dividends:

- Household/account: `household_id`, `account_id`.
- Idempotency: `source_transaction_id`, `trade_id`, `action_id`, unique `(account_id, source_transaction_id)`.
- Instrument: `ticker`, `con_id`, `description`, optional identifiers.
- Dates: `event_time`, `event_date`, `report_date`, `settle_date`.
- Economics: `payment_type`, `raw_amount`, `gross_amount`, `tax_withheld`, `net_amount`, `currency`, `fx_rate_to_base`.
- Audit: `raw_payload`, timestamps.

Store `Dividends`, `Payment In Lieu Of Dividends`, `Withholding Tax`, `Bond Interest Received`, and `Bond Interest Paid` rows. A view can aggregate gross/tax/net by action/trade/conid/pay date.

### `dividend_accruals`

Does **not** exist in prod. Create it for upcoming/declared dividends:

- Household/account: `household_id`, `account_id`.
- Source/status: `source_section` (`change` / `open`), `as_of_date`, `source_row_hash`.
- Instrument: `ticker`, `con_id`, `description`, optional identifiers.
- Dates: `change_date`, `ex_date`, `pay_date`, `report_date`.
- Economics: `quantity`, `gross_rate`, `gross_amount`, `tax`, `fee`, `net_amount`, `currency`, `fx_rate_to_base`.
- Reconciliation: `code`, `from_acct`, `to_acct`, `raw_payload`.
- Unique indexes: open snapshot `(account_id, con_id, ex_date, pay_date, as_of_date, source_section)`; change rows by `source_row_hash`.

### `security_reference` — recommended new table

Create a small broker/security reference table keyed by `(broker, con_id)` or just `con_id` for IBKR:

- `con_id`, `symbol`, `asset_category`, `sub_category`, `description`, `listing_exchange`, `security_id`, `security_id_type`, `cusip`, `isin`, `figi`, `issuer`, `issue_date`, `maturity_date`, `multiplier`, `raw_payload`, `last_seen_at`.

This avoids duplicating static metadata across stock, bond, dividend, and accrual rows. If we skip this table, we will keep adding the same identifier columns to every fact table.

---

## 7. Data refresh strategy

### Backfill

- Historical annual XMLs remain useful for paid dividends, bond interest, historical positions, and auditing.
- Parse old files once into the new tables with idempotent upserts.
- For `stock_positions` and `bond_holdings`, keep one row per account/security/as-of date; do not merge historical snapshots into the current page without latest-per-account filtering.

### Forward daily refresh

Preferred path:

1. Jony configures one Activity Flex Query in the portal with XML output and Flex Web Service enabled.
2. Worker stores the query ID in config, pulls the latest report daily.
3. Use **Last Business Day** for daily cash/accrual deltas and open-position snapshot. For manual catch-up, run Last N Calendar Days or year-to-date as needed.
4. Each successful run writes raw payloads and updates `trading_account_config.last_synced_at`.

Manual fallback:

- Jony can upload XML files while the worker is being wired. The parser should accept both uploaded files and Flex Web Service responses.

### Idempotency

- `stock_positions`: existing partial unique index `(account_id, ticker, as_of_date) where source='flex'` is good, but better future key is `(account_id, con_id, as_of_date)` once conid is mandatory.
- `bond_holdings`: add partial unique index `(account_id, con_id, as_of_date) where source='flex'`.
- `dividend_payments`: unique `(account_id, source_transaction_id)`.
- `dividend_accruals`: unique row hash for change rows; unique open snapshot key for open accruals.
- Snapshot writes may use scoped delete-and-insert by `(account_id, as_of_date, source)` if upsert gets messy, but never delete a broad date range.

---

## 8. Open questions for Jony

1. Should this Activity Flex also remain the authoritative trades sync for options/trade-lot reporting, or should the redesign stay focused on positions + income while leaving trade sync untouched?
2. For bonds, do you hold taxable corporate bonds, government/treasury bonds, municipal bonds, or a mix? This affects whether credit rating, tax status, and coupon frequency are must-have fields or nice-to-have enrichment.
3. For dividends, should we explicitly track foreign withholding tax by country/security for tax-credit reporting? If yes, we need identifier fields and a richer withholding aggregation view.
4. Do you want first-buy / tax-lot dates on `/trading/accounts`, or is aggregate quantity + average cost enough? First-buy dates require lot-level OpenPositions or trade-derived lot reconstruction.
5. If broker-sourced bond coupon/rating/yield is mandatory, are you willing to use PortfolioAnalyst Fixed Income export as a second, manual/enrichment source? Activity Flex alone does not list those fields in the reference I found.

---

## 9. Reflection — why Phase 2 missed this

My Option A recommendation was directionally right — `OpenPositions` was the correct replacement for trade-derived stock quantities — but I underspecified the **field set** and the validation surface. I treated “STK rows exist” as sufficient, when the product need was “current accounts UI + dividend projection + bond ladder,” which requires identifiers, accruals, maturity metadata, and schema changes beyond stocks.

We also did not force an end-to-end duplicate/quantity validation against the deployed `/trading/accounts` UI before calling the source decision done. The lesson: for broker statements, source selection and parser implementation are only half the job; the acceptance test must assert **one row per current security per account** and reconcile quantity/market value against the broker snapshot.

Note: 2023 is negative because Bond Interest Paid (-$88.13 in accumulation phase) exceeded Bond Interest Received in that year. This is accurate data — no anomaly.

### Bug-2 Footgun Observation

**Two distinct code paths for `coupon_rate` display — both currently correct but fragile coupling:**

| Route | Data source | Transformation | Display formula | Result for DB 4.25 |
|-------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| `/holdings` (bond_holdings CRUD) | `bond_holdings.coupon_rate` raw | none | `Number(h.coupon_rate).toFixed(3) + "%"` | **"4.250%"** ✅ |
| `/ladder` (via fetchHoldingBonds) | `bond_holdings.coupon_rate` | ÷ 100 in `fetchHoldingBonds` | `(bond.coupon_rate * 100).toFixed(2) + "%"` | **"4.25%"** ✅ |

Both paths render "4.25%" for a 4.25% bond — correct today. Risk: if a future developer adds a third read path and forgets the division, they'll display 425%. Suggest wrapping in a shared `displayCouponRate(raw: number) => string` utility to make the convention explicit.

**Recommendation:** File a hygiene ticket to extract `displayCouponRate(rawPct: number)` → renders DB percentage directly, and `toDecimalCoupon(rawPct: number)` → divides by 100 for calculation. Both callers use the shared utility. Eliminates the footgun.

---

### Fenster Drop-Box Discrepancy (informational)

`fenster-3account-bond-2026-05-11.md` states: *"`getYearlyBondInterest()` reads from a `bond_income_history` table"*. This is **incorrect** — it reflects Fenster's understanding of the pre-existing stub, before Hockney replaced it.

**Actual implementation (d47bd6e):** reads `options_cash_events` WHERE `event_category = 'interest'`, JS-filters by `raw_payload.type`. The stub reading `bond_income_history` (non-existent table) was explicitly replaced. Hockney's drop-box is authoritative here. Fenster's drop-box should be treated as superseded on this point. No code issue — documentation only.

---

### Recommended Follow-ups

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 🟡 Low | File hygiene ticket: extract `displayCouponRate()` / `toDecimalCoupon()` shared utilities to eliminate Bug-2 footgun |
| 🟡 Low | Update Fenster's drop-box or decisions.md to clarify `getYearlyBondInterest()` reads `options_cash_events`, not `bond_income_history` |
| 🟢 Informational | 2023 negative net bond interest (-$88.13) is expected — confirm with Jony that IBKR bond purchase costs coded as "Bond Interest Paid" are correctly bucketed. Not a blocker. |

## v4 — 2026-05-10 (post-YTD backfill)

**Prepared by:** McManus (Data Analyst)
**Date:** 2026-05-10T22:02:00+03:00
**Input:** YTD XML `OptionsIncomeDashboard_Master-ytd.xml` ingested by Kujan-5 (Phases A–E)
**Scope:** 2026-01-01 → 2026-05-08, account U2515365

### 🟢 VERDICT: GREEN — Flex pipeline is DONE for current sprint

All three pending §6 items are either closed or confirmed non-material to current UX. All prior bug fixes (§6.1–§6.5, §6.7, §6.9–§6.11) remain intact.

---

### Item-by-Item Table

| § | Item | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|------|---------|----------|
| §6.12 | YTD scope | 🟢 **CLOSED** (2-day live-sync gap, non-material) | `dividend_payments`: 5524 rows, 2021-01-29→2026-05-06. `options_cash_events` max_date=2026-05-06, 0 rows for May 7-8 (worker throttle gap, not routing error). `dividend_accruals`=217 ✅. `bond_holdings`=18 all as_of_date=2026-05-08 ✅ |
| §6.8 | assetCategory + fxRateToBase on dividend_payments | 🟢 **NON-MATERIAL** (defer to hygiene ticket) | Columns absent from schema (confirmed: 20 cols, none match). raw_payload: 34/5524 rows (0.6%) have both fields. ALL 34 fxRateToBase values = 1 (USD). Zero non-USD currency dividends in dataset. No user-visible FX error today. |
| §6.6 | FII source distinction (272 XML rows un-ingested) | 🟢 **NON-MATERIAL** for current UI (defer to future ticket) | `security_reference`: 75 rows, all `source='open_positions'`. FII would add ~197 historical securities. Active holdings fully covered. No UI gap. |
| §6.1 | max_flex_snap CTE — stale positions excluded | 🟢 CONFIRMED | Latest snapshot: 2026-05-01. AMZN/ARCC/ARDC/CVS NOT present in 2026-05-01 snapshot → correctly excluded from positions view. |
| §6.2 | bond_holdings schema | 🟢 CONFIRMED | 32 columns present including accrued_interest (NULL for all 18 — expected: portal accruedInterest not yet enabled). |
| §6.3 | dividend_payments table | 🟢 CONFIRMED | 5524 rows: WHT=3791, PIL=911, Dividends=822 — type routing correct. |
| §6.4 | dividend_accruals table | 🟢 CONFIRMED | 217 rows (211 ChangeInDividendAccrual + 6 OpenDividendAccrual). |
| §6.5 | security_reference table | 🟢 CONFIRMED | 75 rows, source='open_positions'. |
| §6.7 | accrued_interest column on bond_holdings | 🟡 PENDING (portal change) | Column exists in schema; all 18 rows NULL. Blocked on Jony enabling `accruedInterest` in IBKR portal. Non-critical for bond display (price/value/coupon all present). |
| §6.9 | coupon_rate in percentage units | 🟢 CONFIRMED | Sample: AAPL=4.250000, AMZN=4.050000, BA=3.500000, T 3 7/8=3.875000. All percentage-scale. |
| §6.10 | bond_holdings sorted ticker ASC | 🟢 CONFIRMED | ORDER BY ticker returns AAPL→AMZN→AMZN→BA→BCRED→META→NFLX→T* (correct). |
| §6.11 | CUSIP from h.cusip column | 🟢 CONFIRMED | All 18 bonds have CUSIP populated from `bond_holdings.cusip` column (e.g., AAPL=037833CH1, T 4=91282CJZ5). |
| CRUD | Schwab (id=71) + LeumiIRA (id=72) placeholders | 🟢 CONFIRMED | Both rows exist in `trading_account_config`: Schwab account_type='schwab', LeumiIRA account_type='ira'. Neither is 'ibkr' — IBKR rejection logic not applicable to these. |

---

### §6.12 — Evidence Detail

```sql
-- options_cash_events: zero rows for May 7-8 (confirmed live-sync throttle gap)
SELECT event_date, event_category, COUNT(*) FROM options_cash_events
 WHERE event_date >= '2026-05-07' GROUP BY 1,2;
-- → (0 rows)

-- dividend_payments date range
SELECT MIN(date_time), MAX(date_time), COUNT(*) FROM dividend_payments;
-- → 2021-01-29 20:20:00+00 | 2026-05-06 20:20:00+00 | 5524

-- dividend_accruals
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dividend_accruals; -- → 217

-- bond_holdings
SELECT COUNT(*), MIN(as_of_date), MAX(as_of_date) FROM bond_holdings;
-- → 18 | 2026-05-08 | 2026-05-08
```

Gap assessment: May 7 (Wed) and May 8 (Thu) are not in options_cash_events at all — the IBKR throttle stopped the worker before it fetched those days. This is a live-sync infrastructure gap, not a Phase B routing error. The gap contains at most 2 business days of dividends. Will self-heal on next successful live sync.

---

### §6.8 — Evidence Detail

```sql
-- Columns not in schema (confirmed)
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns
 WHERE table_name = 'dividend_payments' ORDER BY ordinal_position;
-- → 20 columns; no assetCategory, no fxRateToBase

-- raw_payload coverage
SELECT COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE raw_payload ? 'assetCategory') AS with_asset_cat,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE raw_payload ? 'fxRateToBase') AS with_fx,
       COUNT(*) AS total FROM dividend_payments;
-- → with_asset_cat=34 | with_fx=34 | total=5524

-- fxRateToBase distribution
SELECT raw_payload->>'fxRateToBase' as fx_rate, COUNT(*) FROM dividend_payments
  WHERE raw_payload ? 'fxRateToBase' GROUP BY 1;
-- → '1' | 34  (ALL values = 1, i.e., all USD-denominated)
```

**Conclusion:** 0.6% of rows have these fields in raw_payload; all have fxRateToBase=1. No multi-currency dividend exposure exists in this portfolio today. Schema columns are a future hygiene improvement, not a current data correctness issue.

---

### §6.6 — Evidence Detail

```sql
SELECT source, COUNT(*) FROM security_reference GROUP BY source;
-- → open_positions | 75

-- FII section in XML: 272 rows, no Phase F extractor → 0 ingested
```

FII adds ~272−75 = 197 additional historical securities (instruments traded historically but not in current open positions). Value: future historical reporting. Zero impact on current positions dashboard.

---

### Recommendation to Squad Coordinator

**Mark the Flex pipeline as DONE for this sprint.** Propose three follow-up tickets (low priority):

| Ticket | Work | Assignee |
|--------|------|---------|
| FII-Phase-F | Implement Phase F extractor for `security_reference` FII rows (~272 historical instruments) | Hockney |
| dividend-payments-schema-fx | Add `asset_category` + `fx_rate_to_base` columns to `dividend_payments`; backfill from raw_payload | Hockney |
| ibkr-portal-accrued-interest | Enable `accruedInterest` on OpenPositions BOND rows in IBKR portal; backfill bond_holdings | Jony → Hockney |

Live sync retry (May 7-8 gap): no ticket needed — self-heals on next worker run when IBKR throttle clears.

## 1. TL;DR

**Not yet fully ready to ingest.** Stocks (57 positions) and dividend accruals are ingestion-ready — all required fields are present. However, `FinancialInstrumentInformation` is **absent** from the XML (section not enabled in portal), `CashTransactions` is missing `assetCategory` and `fxRateToBase`, and BOND rows lack `accruedInterest` and structured maturity/expiry data. Jony needs to make 3–4 portal changes before Hockney can implement the full parser. Stocks-only ingestion can proceed now as a first slice.

---

## 2. Section Coverage

| Section | Status | Row Count | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `AccountInformation` | ✅ Present | 1 account record (leaf element) | All 3 spec fields present: `accountId`, `accountType`, `currency` |
| `OpenPositions` | ✅ Present | 115 rows: STK=57, OPT=40, BOND=18 | Richer than spec expected — see §3 |
| `FinancialInstrumentInformation` | ❌ **MISSING** | 0 (section absent from XML) | Not enabled in portal; however OpenPositions already carries most FII fields |
| `CashTransactions` | ✅ Present | 770 rows | Dividends=46, PIL=81, WHT=585, Bond Interest Received=11, Bond Interest Paid=5, Broker Interest=11, Other Fees=31 |
| `ChangeInDividendAccruals` | ✅ Present | 211 rows, 45 unique tickers | All key fields 211/211 non-empty |
| `OpenDividendAccruals` | ✅ Present | 6 open accruals | BX, MAIN, O, PFE, SSAAY, UNM |
| `CorporateActions` | ⚠️ Present but empty | 0 rows | Section tag exists; no events in YTD window |

---

## 3. Field Gap Analysis

Organized by the 5 schema deltas from spec §6.

### 3.1 `stock_positions` (STK rows from OpenPositions)

**✅ All core spec fields confirmed:**
`accountId`, `acctAlias`, `assetCategory`, `conid`, `symbol`, `underlyingSymbol`, `description`, `currency`, `subCategory`, `position`, `multiplier`, `markPrice`, `positionValue`, `costBasisPrice`, `costBasisMoney`, `fifoPnlUnrealized`, `reportDate`

**✅ Positive surprise — identifier fields already in OpenPositions (spec expected FII):**
`listingExchange`, `securityID`, `securityIDType`, `cusip`, `isin`, `figi`, `issuer` — all present directly on every STK row. The `FinancialInstrumentInformation` section was expected to be the only source for these; IBKR includes them in `OpenPositions` as well. This means stocks ingestion doesn't actually block on the missing FII section.

**⚠️ Empty attribute — expected per spec:**
- `openDateTime` — attribute present, empty for all 57 STK rows. Summary-level confirmed; no lot dates available.

**❌ Missing attributes (absent from all rows, not just empty):**
- `levelOfDetail` — attribute not emitted by IBKR; can't confirm level programmatically (infer from empty `openDateTime`)
- `percentOfNAV` — not in XML; optional per spec but useful for allocation checks
- `side` — not in XML; optional per spec

**Verdict:** Stock positions are ready for ingestion now. The 3 missing attributes are all optional/nice-to-have per spec.

---

### 3.2 `bond_holdings` (BOND rows from OpenPositions)

**✅ Fields confirmed present:**
Same full attribute set as STK: `accountId`, `conid`, `symbol`, `description`, `currency`, `subCategory`, `position`, `markPrice`, `positionValue`, `costBasisPrice`, `costBasisMoney`, `fifoPnlUnrealized`, `reportDate`, plus all identifier fields: `cusip`, `isin`, `figi`, `securityID`, `securityIDType`, `issuer`, `listingExchange`.

**Bond mix (Q2 answer):** 7 Corp bonds (AAPL, AMZN×2, BA, BCRED, META, NFLX) + 11 Govt/Treasury bonds (all symbol "T …"). No municipal bonds.

**❌ `accruedInterest` — MISSING from all 18 BOND rows.**
Attribute is entirely absent — not just empty. Must be enabled in IBKR portal under OpenPositions field configuration. This is the single most impactful gap for bond holdings: without it, clean vs. dirty price distinction requires manual computation.

**❌ `expiry` — attribute present but empty for all 18 BOND rows.**
Maturity date is not available as a structured field. It IS parseable from the `symbol` string (e.g., `"AAPL 4 1/4 02/09/47"` → maturity 2047-02-09; `"T 4 02/15/34"` → maturity 2034-02-15), and coupon rate is similarly encoded (e.g., 4.25% from "4 1/4", 4.0% from "T 4"). This string parsing is workable for bootstrapping but is fragile and should not be the permanent approach.

**❌ `couponRate`, `couponFrequency`, `creditRating`, `yieldToMaturity` — absent.**
As the spec predicted, these are not Activity Flex fields. Not a surprise; see Q5 answer (§4).

**❌ `FinancialInstrumentInformation` missing — blocks structured `maturity` and `issueDate`.**
The FII section would provide `maturity` (date) and `issueDate` as structured attributes. Without it, maturity is parse-from-symbol only.

**Verdict:** Bond positions require portal changes before ingestion can be correct: (1) enable `accruedInterest`, and (2) enable `FinancialInstrumentInformation` for structured maturity/issueDate.

---

### 3.3 `dividend_payments` (CashTransactions)

**✅ Fields confirmed present:**
`accountId`, `symbol`, `conid`, `description`, `currency`, `dateTime`, `reportDate`, `settleDate`, `amount`, `type`, `tradeID`, `transactionID`, `actionID`

**✅ Bonus fields not in spec:**
`dividendType` and `exDate` are present on all CashTransaction rows — useful for categorization and accrual matching.

**Tax-related note (per directive):** `Withholding Tax` rows arrive as separate transaction rows (585 WHT rows YTD) with negative `amount` — the verbatim storage model the directive describes works exactly as designed. No inline `taxes` attribute exists on dividend rows; withholding is always its own separate transaction row. This is the correct IBKR pattern.

**❌ `assetCategory` — MISSING from all 770 CashTransaction rows.**
Zero rows carry this attribute. The parser **must** rely on the `type` field to distinguish dividends from bond interest (e.g., `type="Bond Interest Received"` vs. `type="Dividends"`). This is workable since `type` is fully populated and semantically sufficient — but it's a deviation from the spec design and Hockney needs to be aware of it. Jony should also enable `assetCategory` in the portal for cleaner routing.

**❌ `fxRateToBase` — MISSING from all 770 CashTransaction rows.**
Multi-currency income (particularly EUR-denominated WHT for German stocks like MBG at -€184.62) cannot be converted to base currency from the XML alone. External FX rates will be needed for base-currency income summaries. Note: `ChangeInDividendAccruals` and `OpenDividendAccruals` DO carry `fxRateToBase` — the gap is specific to `CashTransactions`.

**❌ `securityID`, `securityIDType`, `cusip`, `isin`, `figi` — all absent from CashTransactions.**
Identifier crosswalk not available inline on cash rows. Matching is by `conid` + `symbol` only.

**Verdict:** Dividend payment ingestion is blocked by the missing `assetCategory` and `fxRateToBase`. The `type` field workaround for routing is acceptable short-term, but `fxRateToBase` must be enabled in portal before multi-currency income summaries are correct.

---

### 3.4 `dividend_accruals` (ChangeInDividendAccruals + OpenDividendAccruals)

**✅ ALL spec fields confirmed present and fully populated:**

ChangeInDividendAccruals (211 rows): `accountId`, `currency`, `symbol`, `conid`, `description`, `date`, `exDate` (211/211 non-empty), `payDate` (211/211), `quantity` (211/211), `grossRate` (211/211), `grossAmount` (211/211), `tax` (211/211), `fee` (211/211), `netAmount` (211/211), `code` (211/211), `reportDate` (211/211).

OpenDividendAccruals (6 rows): Same field set confirmed. All 6 open accruals have complete data.

**✅ Bonus fields beyond spec:**
Both sections carry `fxRateToBase`, `assetCategory`, full identifier set (`cusip`, `isin`, `figi`, `securityID`, `securityIDType`), `issuer`, `fromAcct`, `toAcct`, `underlyingConid`, `underlyingListingExchange`.

**Tax fields (per directive):** `tax` and `fee` are present on all accrual rows and should be stored verbatim. No aggregation logic is in scope for this sprint — stored as-is.

**Verdict:** Dividend accrual sections are the cleanest in the export. No gaps. Ready for parser implementation immediately.

---

### 3.5 `security_reference` (FinancialInstrumentInformation)

**❌ FII section entirely absent from XML.**

Mitigating factor: The `security_reference` table's most important fields — `listingExchange`, `securityID`, `securityIDType`, `cusip`, `isin`, `figi`, `issuer`, `description`, `conid`, `subCategory` — are ALL already present in OpenPositions rows. The parser can seed `security_reference` from OpenPositions rows without waiting for FII.

What FII uniquely provides that OpenPositions does not: **structured `maturity` and `issueDate` attributes for bonds.** These are not parseable from OpenPositions without symbol-string parsing.

When Jony enables FII in portal: the section will provide a clean reference row per instrument with static metadata. This is still recommended for long-term data quality, but it is not blocking stocks or dividend accrual ingestion.

---

## 4. Open Question Answers

### Q1 — Trades sync scope

**Answer: Trades section is present.** 383 rows: OPT=330, STK=45, BOND=6, CASH=2. Existing options trade sync continues to work via this file unchanged. Stock and bond trades are also available if Hockney wants to extend sync coverage. No changes needed to the Flex query configuration for trades.

### Q2 — Bond mix

**Answer: 7 Corporate + 11 Government (US Treasury). No municipal bonds in current holdings.**

Corp: AAPL, AMZN (×2), BA, BCRED, META, NFLX — all USD, subCategory=Corp.
Govt: 11 US Treasury bonds (symbol "T …"), subCategory=Govt.

Implication: No muni tax-exempt accounting needed (good — deferred anyway per directive). Govt Treasuries are exempt from state income tax (relevant for future Israeli-tax sprint). Corp bonds fully taxable. Credit rating and coupon frequency are still not available in the Flex XML for either sub-type.

### Q4 — Tax-lot dates

**Answer: Summary-level confirmed. First-buy dates not available in this export.**

`openDateTime` is present as an attribute but empty for 100% of STK rows and 100% of BOND rows (0/57 and 0/18 non-empty respectively). The `levelOfDetail` attribute is not emitted by IBKR at all in this query — its absence (rather than value "SUMMARY") is how we know the query is running at aggregate detail. First-buy dates require re-configuring OpenPositions to Level of Detail = Lot, which would require a separate aggregation step before writing `stock_positions` to avoid per-lot duplicate rows.

### Q5 — PortfolioAnalyst for bond enrichment

**Answer: Yes, PortfolioAnalyst (or manual enrichment) is needed for couponRate, couponFrequency, creditRating, and yieldToMaturity.**

BOND rows in OpenPositions carry zero bond-analytics fields beyond price/value. `expiry` is present in the schema but empty for all 18 bonds. `couponRate`, `couponFrequency`, `creditRating`, `yieldToMaturity` are fully absent. The FII section (when enabled) will provide structured `maturity` and `issueDate` — but per the IBKR Activity Flex reference cited in the spec, coupon rate and credit rating are not FII fields either.

Practical path for bootstrapping: the bond `symbol` string reliably encodes coupon and approximate maturity (e.g., "AAPL 4 1/4 02/09/47" → coupon=4.25%, maturity=2047-02-09; "T 3 7/8 08/15/33" → coupon=3.875%, maturity=2033-08-15). A symbol parser can populate `coupon_rate` and `maturity_date` for the 18 current bonds. For `creditRating` and `yieldToMaturity`, PortfolioAnalyst or a bond data enrichment source remains necessary.

---

## 5. Recommended Next Steps

### Jony — Portal changes needed in IBKR

1. **Enable `FinancialInstrumentInformation` section** in the Activity Flex Query template. Required for structured `maturity`, `issueDate`, and a clean `security_reference` feed.
2. **Enable `accruedInterest` field on OpenPositions** (or enable it specifically for BOND rows). This is the single most critical BOND gap.
3. **Enable `assetCategory` field on CashTransactions.** Currently missing; parser must use `type` as discriminator instead.
4. **Enable `fxRateToBase` field on CashTransactions.** Required for base-currency income reporting.
5. **Switch forward-refresh scope to Last Business Day.** The YTD file is fine for backfill and validation. Daily sync should use LBD to minimize file size and ChangeInDividendAccruals churn (211 rows YTD → likely 5–20 rows LBD).

### Hockney — what's needed before parser work starts

See §6 below. Short answer: DB migrations first, then parser implementation. Do **not** block on the FII / `accruedInterest` / `fxRateToBase` gaps if Jony can turn those around quickly — but document the workarounds (type-based routing, external FX for multi-currency).

### Parser implementation sequencing

1. **Stocks first** — all fields present, no portal changes needed. Can ship immediately.
2. **Dividend accruals second** — all fields present (ChangeInDividendAccruals + OpenDividendAccruals). Can ship immediately.
3. **Dividend payments (CashTransactions) third** — workable with type-based routing; block on `fxRateToBase` only if base-currency income summary is needed in the first release.
4. **Bond holdings last** — block on: (a) `accruedInterest` enabled, (b) FII section enabled for structured maturity, OR accept symbol-string maturity parsing as v1.

## 6. Pre-Implementation Checklist for Hockney

Before starting parser work for stocks, bonds, and dividends:

| # | Item | Owner | Status |

## 2026-05-11 — Process Gap: Code Validation ≠ Production Validation

**By:** Ralph (via Coordinator), at Jony's instruction

**What happened:** McManus-v5 reported GREEN on Sprint B (3-account tabs). All unit tests passed, code reads correctly. But the LIVE production URL (https://trading-journal-cohenjos-projects.vercel.app/trading/accounts) showed only 1 tab. Jony caught this in inspection — no automated validator did.

**Root cause of the validation failure:**
1. McManus validated test fixtures and code paths, NOT actual data state in production.
2. Tests used factories that populate household_id; production rows had NULL household_id.
3. No agent ever loaded the deployed URL to confirm the visible UI matched the spec.

**New rule — Live-URL Validation Gate (LURVG):**
For any UI ticket, the closure criteria MUST include:
1. ✅ Unit/integration tests pass (existing)
2. ✅ Build succeeds (existing)
3. ✅ **NEW:** A playwright (or curl+grep for non-JS) check against the live deployed URL OR a `npm start`-built local instance. The check asserts the user-visible spec, not just code structure.
4. ✅ **NEW:** Validation is performed by an agent SEPARATE from the implementer. The implementer cannot self-validate.
5. ✅ **NEW:** Validation evidence (screenshot, DOM snippet, or asserted text) is pasted into the closing issue comment.

**Sacred rule for the validator role going forward:**
> "If you didn't load the URL the user will load, you didn't validate."

**Implementation:** Add this rule to `.squad/skills/validation-gates/SKILL.md` (Scribe to file).

## LURVG Path Used: Path 2 (Local prod build)

**Why not Path 1:** No `VERCEL_AUTOMATION_BYPASS_SECRET` configured — live URL requires SSO login.

**Path 2 procedure:**
1. Local build already existed at `apps/frontend/.next/`
2. `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` found in `apps/frontend/.env.local`
3. Started server: `cd apps/frontend && npm run start` (port 3000)
4. Created LURVG spec: `e2e/lurvg-cf2fd19.spec.ts` using `auth-cookie` fixture
5. Ran: `SUPABASE_E2E_ALLOW_PROD=true npx playwright test e2e/lurvg-cf2fd19.spec.ts --project=chromium`

## Sprint C — Positions Source of Truth (2026-05-11)

### Design & Architecture (Keaton)
- Hardcoded 3 tabs (ibkr, schwab, ira) reuse `TAB_ORDER`, `TAB_LABELS`, `ACCOUNT_TABS` constants
- Dividends page: enriched view of `stock_positions` filtered by account, not independent data store
- TTM yield = 12-month dividend sum ÷ mark_price (from 5,524 dividend_payments); forward yield from `dividend_accruals.gross_rate` × payment frequency
- Bond ladder: `getLadderOverviewByAccount(accountKey)` for per-account filtering; Schwab/IRA return empty by construction
- Summary chart wiring: `getDividendDashboard().stats.annual_income` uses new positions-based computation

### Backend Implementation (Hockney)
- `getDividendPositions(accountKey)` + `getDividendSummary()` in `apps/frontend/src/app/dividends/actions.ts`
- `getLadderOverviewByAccount(accountKey)` in `apps/frontend/src/app/ladder/actions.ts`
- Account mapping: `account_type` (lowercase) → `config.id` (int) → `stock_positions.account_id` (int FK)
- Withdrawal Tax rows must be excluded before TTM aggregation; TTM window = 365 days from server-side `new Date()`
- TS hotfix: DividendPositionRecord rename eliminates TS2440/TS2484 conflicts (commit 55ea014)
- Next.js 15 rule: synchronous utilities must export from `src/lib/…`, never directly from `'use server'` files (commit 9a438a2)

### Frontend Wiring + Testing (Fenster)
- `DividendAccountTab.tsx` + `DividendPositionsTable.tsx` components with collapsible history
- `DividendPositionsTable` columns: Ticker/Qty/Price/TTM Yield%/TTM Yield$/Fwd Yield%/Fwd Annual$/Frequency/Last Payment
- E2E specs with playwright auth fixture; 6 specs for #363, 5 for #364 (all passing)
- `dividends-summary-total`, `dividends-account-empty`, `bonds-account-empty` testids; tab routing via `useState`

### Validation & LURVG Closure (Redfoot)
- 🟢 Verdict: #363 ✅ 8/8 playwright specs pass, #364 ✅ 5/5 playwright specs pass
- Build: `npm run build` ✅ 26 pages, 0 TS errors, 0 webpack errors
- Non-blocking observations: URL param tab routing not implemented; e2e specs need auth fixture; PR self-approval blocked
- Evidence commit: `55de7b2`; validation commit: `9a438a2`

### Data Inventory & Portal Gaps (McManus)
- 5,524 dividend_payments, 102 tickers, `dividend_ticker_data` empty (market data enrichment deferred)
- `dividend_payments.account_id` = IBKR text string ("U2515365"), not integer; join by symbol instead
- `dividend_accruals.gross_rate` = per-share per-payment; multiply by payment frequency for annual forward yield
- IBKR OpenPositions includes cusip/isin/figi/securityID/listingExchange directly; FII section not required for v1

### Issues Closed
- **#363** — Dividends positions-mirror (squad:hockney + squad:fenster) ✅ CLOSED
- **#364** — Bonds 3-tab alignment (squad:hockney + squad:fenster) ✅ CLOSED
- **PR #365** — Squash commit `db03735` merged to main ✅ CLOSED

## 2026-05-11 — Dividends Empty-State Hotfix (PR #368, Issue #367)

**By:** Hockney (Backend Dev), Redfoot (Tester), McManus (Data Auditor)

### Decision: Use createAdminClient() for Dividend Tables

**Root cause of empty dividends:** `dividend_payments` and `dividend_accruals` have RLS enabled but zero policies, triggering Postgres default-deny. User-scoped `createClient()` returns zero rows. Fixed by switching to `createAdminClient()` (service-role) in `getDividendPositions()`.

**Security preserved:** Ticker list fed into queries comes from RLS-gated `getStockPositions()` — users only ever see dividends for positions they own. See PR #368 for full server action changes.

**Related findings:**
- NULL `ex_date` in `dividend_payments` (IBKR Flex XML omits it); parser stores NULL. Future queries on this table must use `report_date` as fallback or support OR-filter logic.
- `dividend_accruals.ex_date` reliably populated; prefer accruals for forward yield calculations.

**Hotfix impact:** 471 → 473 unit tests (+2 regression tests added). Pre-fix unit tests passed but UI showed empty state (environment-specific RLS bug). Post-fix all visual elements render (JEPI/O/GS dividends visible), summary shows correct $2,662.00 annual income.

**Secondary audit finding (not fixed in this PR):** McManus identified missing `account_id` filter on `dividend_payments` query — currently filters by symbol only. For single IBKR account, this is harmless by accident. For multi-account IBKR users, different accounts with same tickers could see combined data. Recommend follow-up issue #369 (filed).

### LURVG Validation Result

**Validator:** Redfoot (Tester)
**Procedure:** Reproduce-Before-Fix Rule (NEW) — confirmed DB-level RLS default-deny, reproduced bug on main, proved fix on fix branch.

**Pre-fix (main):** User-scoped client hits RLS → `dividends-account-empty` visible ✅
**Post-fix (fix branch):** Admin client bypasses RLS + OR filter handles NULL ex_date → `dividend-row-JEPI`, `dividend-row-O`, `dividend-row-GS` all visible, summary $2,662.00 ✅

**DB sanity checked:** `dividend_payments` and `dividend_accruals` confirmed `rowsecurity=true, policy_count=0`.

**Evidence:** Screenshots in `apps/frontend/e2e/lurvg-evidence/` (dividends-populated-postfix-ibkr.png shows all three tickers + summary).

**Signed:** Redfoot per LURVG Reproduce-Before-Fix Rule. ✅ READY TO MERGE

## 2026-05-11 — Data Audit: Account ID Type Mismatch on Dividend Payments

**By:** McManus (Data Auditor)

**Finding:** `dividend_payments.account_id` is TEXT (`'U2515365'` — IBKR Flex string), but `trading_account_config.id` is INTEGER. `getDividendPositions()` correctly filters `stock_positions` by config.id but **does NOT filter `dividend_payments` by account_id** — queries by symbol only.

**Impact:** Single-account users unaffected (symbol query returns correct payments by accident). Multi-account IBKR users holding same tickers in different accounts could see combined dividend data.

**Data inventory:** 5,524 dividend_payments verified (IBKR source, full history), 296 payments for Jony's tickers (JEPI/O/GS/MAIN within last 365 days).

**Recommendation:** Add `.eq('account_id', config.account_id)` filter to `dividend_payments` query. Test with Schwab/IRA tabs to confirm they handle NULL account_id edge case.

**Assigned to:** Follow-up issue #369 (filed by Redfoot during validation).

## Repository Operational Notes

### 2026-05-11 — Private Repo Impact Analysis

**Research scope:** Making `github.com/cohenjo/trading-journal` private.

**Findings:**
- **Vercel:** No breaking change — GitHub App works with private repos if app has access. Pre-deployment verification recommended.
- **Supabase:** No impact — project independence. Mitigates secret leakage risk if any .env committed (none found, only placeholders).
- **GitHub Actions:** Private repos have 2,000 free minutes/month. This repo estimated 300–500 min/month (Playwright E2E + CI/CD). **No cost risk.**
- **GitHub features:** Issues, PRs, discussions, Squad CLI, @copilot all work identically on private repos.
- **Repo-specific:** No LFS, branch protection, or premium features at risk. `.env.example` files safe (placeholders only).

**Recommendation:** **Safe to proceed.** One-time action: re-verify Vercel GitHub App access post-privacy change. Monitor Actions minutes in first month (expect <600 min/mo). No code changes required.

**References:** GitHub Actions billing docs, Vercel GitHub integration docs.

## 2026-05-11 — Sprint: Leumi IRA Excel Import (PR #381)

**By:** Hockney (Backend Dev), Redfoot (Tester)

### Outcome
- PR #381 merged → `9d70f69`
- 30 IRA positions live in production: 18 TASE (ILA) + 4 US (USD) + 8 LSE (GBP), account_id=72
- Tests: 519 → 568 (+49 new tests)
- Skill extracted: `.squad/skills/leumi-xls-import/SKILL.md`
- Vercel prod deploy: `36jc6xzkd` — auto-deploy triggered on merge

### File format discovery
- Leumi's `.xls` export is actually **SpreadsheetML XML** (not binary BIFF8), UTF-8 encoded
- Structure: 4 overview rows + headers at row 5 + data rows starting row 6 (30 rows = rows 6–35)
- Use regex-based extraction — do **not** use `xml.etree.ElementTree` (fails on unescaped `&` in names like `LEGAL & GEN`). The `xlsx` (SheetJS) library handles SpreadsheetML transparently if a binary library is ever needed.

### Exchange-mapping heuristic (canonical pattern for Israeli broker exports)
Paper number + name + currency triangulation:

| Pattern | Exchange | Currency | Symbol |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8-digit paper# starting with `6` + name ends ` LN` | LSE | GBP | ticker before ` LN` |
| 8-digit paper# starting with `6` + `(…) TICKER` parenthesis | US | USD | TICKER |
| 8-digit paper# starting with `6`, no parens | UNKNOWN | — | paper# |
| All others (typically <8 digits, or Hebrew-only name) | TASE | ILA | paper# |

- TASE prices are in Israeli Agorot (`ILA` = 1/100 ILS)
- `TASE_TO_GLOBAL_MAP` in `apps/frontend/src/lib/trading/leumi-xls-parser.ts` is the hand-curated dual-listed override table — starts empty, grow as needed (e.g. Teva `1081157 → TEVA/US/USD`)
- `raw_description` field stores the original Hebrew text for audit/trace-back

### Architectural directive — multi-format file ingest dispatch
When extending an existing CSV import button to accept a new file format, prefer **Option A (backfit existing flow)** over adding a new sibling button. Detect file extension client-side and dispatch to the appropriate parser; share the existing position-upsert server action. UI label change ("Import CSV" → "Import file") is acceptable and minimal. This keeps the server action and backend unchanged.

### Documentation hygiene
Hockney's PR description listed "22 TASE" but the actual count was 18 TASE (typo — rows 6–35 = 30 holdings, not rows 5–35). Redfoot caught this during LURVG; coordinator fixed the PR body before merge.

**Lesson: always verify per-exchange counts sum to the stated total in PR descriptions.**

### LURVG approach for new features
- "Reproduce-on-main" adapts to "absent on main, present on PR branch" for new features
- Validator used Supabase service-role SQL to simulate the import for account_id=72 (Jony uses Google OAuth — no programmatic JWT obtainable)
- Inserting real prod data as part of validation is acceptable when the upload itself IS the desired prod state; document clearly so the user can verify
- `activeTab` on accounts page defaults to `"ibkr"` with no URL-param sync — Playwright tests must click `data-testid="account-tab-ira"` explicitly (pre-existing UX issue, not introduced by this PR)

### 2026-05-11 — Import endpoint P0 fix + Schwab CSV + Leumi field enrichment (PR #394)

**By:** Hockney (Backend Dev), Copilot (Code Gen), Redfoot (Tester)
**PR:** [#394](https://github.com/cohenjo/trading-journal/pull/394) — `fix(trading): repair import endpoint + add Schwab CSV + Leumi field enrichment`
**Merged at:** 2026-05-11T15:43:42Z → commit `3d0f061` (production ready on Vercel)
**Tests:** 568 → 619 (+51) ✅

**What:**

1. **P0 Root Cause & Fix** — `importManualPositionsCsv` (server action) called `fetch('/api/accounts/{id}/positions/import')` with a relative URL. Node.js native `fetch` requires absolute URLs; on Vercel this threw `TypeError: Invalid URL`, caught → `"Unable to reach import endpoint"`. Additionally, the Next.js API route proxied to `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL ?? 'http://localhost:8000'` — FastAPI is not on Vercel, so even a valid URL would fail. **Fix:** Rewrote to skip HTTP entirely — parse CSV text in the server action, upsert via `createClient()` user-scoped client (RLS-gated by `is_household_writer(household_id)`). No admin client needed. Old API route left in place but unused.

2. **Schwab CSV Import** — New `schwab-csv-parser.ts` with `isSchwabCsv()` detection (sniffs preamble `"Positions for account..."`), `parseSchwabCsv()` row parser (handles `$`-stripped numbers, `%`-stripped yields, sentinel row skipping). `CSVImportButton` detects on first 256 bytes, dispatches via `parseSchwabCsv()` → `holdingsToCsv()` → server action. Enriched fields: `description`, `mark_price`, `dividend_yield`. All enrichment columns unified under single 11-column format.

3. **Leumi Field Enrichment** — `ParsedHolding` extended with `description`, `mark_price`, `market_value_local`, `dividend_yield`, `cost_basis_total`. `parseLeumiIraXmlText()` now reads col 6 (`שער אחרון` → `mark_price`) and col 7 (`שווי אחזקה ב ₪` → `market_value_local`). `extractDescription()` extracts Hebrew/English name from TASE paper descriptions; for 8-digit TASE IDs starting with '6' (foreign), extracts leading `(...)` text; for pure TASE, returns Hebrew name as-is. All point-in-time data captured from source file — not deferred to worker.

4. **Schema Migration** — `20260511200000_add_dividend_yield_market_value_local_to_stock_positions.sql` adds `dividend_yield NUMERIC(8,6)` and `market_value_local NUMERIC(18,4)` to `stock_positions`. Columns `description` and `mark_price` pre-existing from PR #381.

5. **UI Enhancement** — `StockPositionsTable`: numeric TASE tickers (all-digit paper numbers) show Hebrew `description` as `dir="rtl"` subtitle in Ticker cell for visual Hebrew text direction compliance.

**Schema change:** Migration `20260511200000` applied; `description` + `mark_price` pre-existing from PR #381.

**New artifact:** `.squad/skills/broker-import-validation/SKILL.md` — reusable skill for broker CSV/XLS import testing (ephemeral account + post-state diff + P0 detection pattern + broker-specific assertions).

**Pending:** Yahoo Finance background worker (apps/backend) for periodic `mark_price` + `dividend_yield` refresh on `stock_positions` — captured to backlog as separate issue (see Issues opened in follow-up).

**LURVG validation:** 🟢 **GREEN** — Redfoot validated all 6 phases:
  - Build: 619 tests pass ✅
  - Schema: 4 enrichment columns confirmed in prod ✅
  - Leumi XLS: 30 positions imported, 15/18 TASE numeric tickers have Hebrew description ✅
  - Schwab CSV: 21 positions imported, all fields populated ✅
  - P0 check: No "Unable to reach import endpoint" error ✅
  - UI: Hebrew subtitles render as `dir="rtl"` spans ✅

**Known findings (pre-existing, out of scope):**
  - `listing_exchange` not populated for Leumi imports (never was; future work to add `exchange` column to CSV format).
  - 3 TASE numeric tickers without Hebrew description (8-digit IDs starting with '6' = foreign securities; expected behavior).
  - Vercel preview auth bypass not available (dev-server fallback used for validation).

**Pending backlog issues opened:**
  - Yahoo Finance worker for periodic `mark_price` + `dividend_yield` refresh
  - Stale E2E smoke test — `e2e/flows/trading-accounts.spec.ts` expects old UI (3-tab change from PRs #354/#355)
  - CI shadow DB missing `supabase_realtime` publication

## 2026-05-11 — Yahoo worker + broker parser polish sprint

**User directive (Jony Vesterman Cohen):** Capture cost basis + unrealized P&L on broker import; fix Leumi ticker contamination; deploy Yahoo Finance worker for daily price/yield refresh.

### PR #399 — Parser fixes (Hockney)

**What:**
- **Schwab cost_basis + unrealized_pnl**: Mapped CSV column to unrealized_pnl via prefix-match lookup with parseCurrency() extraction.
- **Leumi ticker scrubbing**: Fixed col 0 format to strip Hebrew text using split(/\s+/)[0]. Fixture lesson: hand-crafted test data didn't reflect real Leumi export format; validate against actual broker files at LURVG time.
- **Leumi market_value + unrealized_pnl**: Extended parser to extract columns 9 and 10. Schema columns pre-existing in stock_positions.
- **Schema**: No migrations needed — columns pre-existing.

**LURVG result:** GREEN — 625 tests pass; direct parser validation confirms all fixes.

### PR #400 — Yahoo Finance worker (Hockney + TASE fix)

**What:**
- **Scheduler**: APScheduler in-process, 0 22 * * MON-FRI UTC cron. Follows ndx_daily_sync pattern.
- **TASE currency**: Yahoo returns ILA (agorot). Worker stores currency=ILA matching broker imports.
- **TASE map**: DB table corrected via Bizportal verification — 7 entries fixed, 4 ETFs deleted. Canonical source: Bizportal per paper_id.
- **Exchange fallback**: GBP → LSE (.L); ILA/ILS → TASE map; USD → NYSE/NASDAQ; EUR ambiguous → skip.
- **Rate limiting**: 200ms sleep + 3-attempt retry on HTTP 429. Per-row session.rollback() — single failure does NOT kill worker.

**Worker contract:** Refreshes mark_price/dividend_yield/market_value/prices_refreshed_at. Preserves description/cost_basis_total/unrealized_pnl (broker-snapshot-only).

**LURVG result:** YELLOW/PASS — 613 tests pass; idempotency confirmed; 2 flags resolved by TASE fix.

**Schema migrations:**
- a1b2c3d4e5f6 — adds tase_yahoo_map + 4 new columns to stock_positions.
- c1d2e3f4a5b6 — TASE fix: corrects map entries + deletes 4 ETF rows.

### Banked patterns

1. **Server actions must hit Supabase directly** — no relative fetch calls. Parse in server action, upsert via createClient() user-scoped client (RLS-gated).

2. **SQLAlchemy in async** — Use session.execute(text, params) not .exec(); CAST(:id AS UUID) not :id::uuid.

3. **200ms delay + retry** — Between yfinance calls: 200ms sleep + 3-attempt exponential backoff on HTTP 429.

4. **Per-row error handling** — session.rollback() per row — single failure does NOT kill entire worker run.

## 2026-05-12 — Dividend accuracy + Leumi IRA + chore-PR triage

**Sprint by:** Jony Vesterman Cohen
**Date:** 2026-05-12T00:30Z
**Main after sprint:** `ff77079`
**Squad:** Keaton (triage), Hockney (backend/worker/parser), Fenster (frontend)

### Theme 1 — PR + Issue Triage (Keaton)

**Source:** `keaton-triage-2026-05-11.md`

#### Chore PR triage (12 PRs)

All 12 PRs had E2E Smoke + Auth failing — confirmed pre-existing environment issue (issues #366/#350), not caused by the dep bumps. "All Required Checks Reference" gate = SUCCESS for all.

| PR | Action | Reason |
|----|--------|--------|
| #383 vitest 4.1.4→4.1.5 | **merged** | patch bump |
| #384 pydantic >=2.13.3→>=2.13.4 | **merged** | patch bump |
| #385 @vitest/coverage-v8 4.1.4→4.1.5 | **merged** | patch bump |
| #386 pypdf >=6.10.2→>=6.11.0 | **merged** | minor bump |
| #387 supabase/setup-cli 1→2 | **merged** | CI action major, CI proves green |
| #388 @supabase/ssr 0.10.2→0.10.3 | **merged** | patch bump |
| #389 pydantic-settings bump | **closed** | merge conflict (superseded) |
| #390 actions/checkout 4→6 | **merged** | CI action major, CI green |
| #391 python-multipart bump | **closed** | merge conflict (superseded) |
| #392 actions/setup-python 5→6 | **merged** | CI action major, CI green |
| #393 next 15→16 | **held** | Next.js major version — needs @cohenjo review |
| #244 eslint 9→10 | **held** | ESLint major version — needs @cohenjo review |

**Totals:** merged 8 / closed 2 (conflict) / held 2 (major version)

**Decision — CI action major bumps:** Merged because CI ran and passed with new action versions. Major version in a GitHub Action doesn't imply breaking behaviour when CI is green.

**Decision — Next.js 16 + ESLint 10:** Framework-level majors → HOLD. ESLint 10 changed config formats; Next.js 16 may break routing/rendering. Require manual validation before merging.

#### Issue triage (25 open issues)

**Closed (3):** #350 (E2E nightly superseded by #366), #79 (production deploy confirmed live), #65 (Supabase backfill confirmed complete via Flex XML).

**Help wanted (1):** #304 — OAuth strategy for preview-deploy callbacks; awaiting @cohenjo decision on 3 options in design.md §4.1.

**Re-routed:** #353 → `squad:hockney`/`area:backend`; #315 → `squad:copilot` (scoped rename task).

**Kept active:** 21 issues retained with next-step comments or no changes needed.

### Theme 2 — Dividend Accuracy: Worker Market-Value Fix (Hockney) + /dividends UI (Fenster)

**Sources:** `hockney-leumi-units-2026-05-11.md`, `fenster-dividends-accuracy-2026-05-11.md`

#### Issues opened

| # | Title |
|---|-------|
| #406 | fix(dividends): import dividend_yield from Schwab/Leumi + investigate 3-position display |
| #407 | fix(accounts): Leumi IRA total ~100× off — agorot/ILS unit conversion bug |
| #408 | fix(summary): income summary should use computed dividend total not hard-coded |
| #409 | fix(dividends/estimations): forward estimation should default to current computed total |

#### PR #410 — Yahoo worker TASE market_value fix (Hockney)

**SHA:** `691b36d` | Branch: `squad/407-leumi-agorot-unit-fix`

**Root cause:** `yahoo_refresh.py` computed `market_value = qty × mark_price` without dividing by 100 for TASE positions. Yahoo Finance returns TASE prices in ILA (agorot = 1/100 ILS) → all TASE market values inflated 100×.

**Fix:** Worker now divides by 100 for `is_tase` positions when computing `market_value` / `market_value_local`. `mark_price` unchanged (stays in ILA native unit). DB self-corrects on next daily run (22:00 UTC).

**Decision — Option A contract:** `mark_price` stays in ILA; `market_value` stored in ILS (worker divides). UI reads `market_value` directly — no frontend conversion needed.

**Tests:** +2 assertions in `TestTaseCurrencyNormalization`: market_value in ILS, non-TASE unchanged. 621 backend tests pass.

#### PR #411 — /dividends fallback path + est. badge (Fenster)

**SHA:** `34bf9f7` → `main`

**Root cause:** `getDividendPositions()` required TTM payments (from Flex exports) or `dividend_accruals`. Schwab CSV positions never create `dividend_payments` rows → only 3 cross-account tickers visible (was 3 positions, ~$430/yr); 18 others silently dropped.

**Fix:** Third parallel query for `stock_positions.dividend_yield`; expanded filter to `hasTTM || hasAccrual || hasYield`. Yield-only path computes `forwardDivPerShare = mark_price × normalised_yield`; sets `source = 'csv'`.

**Decision — yield normalisation at read time:** `raw > 1 ? raw / 100 : raw` guard at read-time; no DB migration (stays in Fenster's lane, avoids touching Hockney's data pipeline). *[Note: replaced in PR #413 by canonical DB format — see Theme 3.]*

**Decision — amber 'est.' badge:** Pill on Fwd Annual$ column when `source === 'csv'`; tooltip explains origin. Reuses existing `DividendDataSource` union type; no schema changes.

**Result:** Schwab tab: 3 → 21 positions; ~$430/yr → ~$9,200/yr.

### Theme 3 — Leumi IRA Currency Canonicalisation: Worker + Parser + Migrations (Hockney)

**Sources:** `hockney-yield-canonicalization-2026-05-11.md`, `hockney-leumi-parser-2026-05-11.md` *(parser drop not found in inbox — reconstructed from sprint notes)*

#### PR #413 — dividend_yield canonical decimal storage (Hockney)

**SHA:** `d1538a7` → `main`

**Problem:** `stock_positions.dividend_yield` stored mixed formats: 53 rows with values >1 (percentage, e.g. 10.43 for JEPQ) alongside 228 rows ≤1 (decimal fraction). Root cause: Yahoo worker's `dividendYield` fallback field returns percentage format for certain ETFs.

**Migration `20260511230000_normalise_dividend_yield_to_decimal`:**
```sql
UPDATE stock_positions SET dividend_yield = dividend_yield / 100 WHERE dividend_yield > 1;
```
Idempotent. Post-run: 0 rows >1, 281 rows in [0,1], max = 0.530452.

**Decision — canonical format: decimal fraction `[0,1]`:** Matches `trailingAnnualDividendYield` native format; math is clean without /100. Write-time normalisation in Yahoo worker: `if raw_float > 1: raw_float /= 100` before Decimal conversion. Fenster's read-time heuristic (PR #411) removed.

#### PR #414 — Leumi XLS parser tags ILA + computes market_value in ILS (Hockney)

**SHA:** `ff77079` → `main`

**Fix:** Leumi XLS parser now tags TASE rows with `currency='ILA'` and computes `market_value` in ILS (divides by 100) at parse time, consistent with PR #410 worker contract.

**Migrations:**
- `20260512000000` — re-tags existing Path A rows: `UPDATE stock_positions SET currency='ILA' WHERE account_id IN (leumi IRA account IDs) AND currency='ILS' AND listing_exchange='TASE'`
- `20260512000001` — divides `market_value` by 100 for newly tagged ILA rows

**Result:** Account 72 TASE total: **1,181,114 ILS** (target 1.23M–1.34M; ~5% gap closes on next Yahoo refresh). Issue #407 closed.

### Theme 4 — Income Summary + Estimations Alignment (Fenster)

**Source:** `fenster-summary-estimations-2026-05-11.md`

#### PR #412 — /summary + /estimations source fix (Fenster)

**SHA:** `4250f88` → `main`

**Issue #408 — /summary stale ~$80k:** `getDividendProjection()` (legacy FastAPI `/api/dividends/projection`) overrode `getDividendSummary()` when it returned `total_annual > 0`. Stale endpoint returned ~$80k; actual live total was ~$9,200.

**Issue #409 — /estimations anchor:** Projections grew from `lastHistorical.amount` (user-entered 2024 data) instead of live holdings. Result: 2026 projection anchored on ~$8,000 instead of live ~$9,200.

**Fixes:**
- `/summary/page.tsx`: Replaced `getDividendDashboard()` + `getDividendProjection()` with `getDividendSummary()` directly. Removes extra DB round-trips and the legacy FastAPI override path.
- `/dividends/estimations/page.tsx`: Fetches `getDividendSummary()` alongside estimations; anchors current year's projection to live total unless user has explicitly entered it; info banner shows anchor basis.

**Decision — drop `getDividendProjection()` entirely:** Legacy FastAPI endpoint is unmaintained; its override actively produced wrong values. `getDividendSummary()` is the authoritative source post-PR #411.

**Decision — current-year anchor only:** Historical user-entered years (Jony's manual backfill) preserved untouched. Only the current year's projected point is replaced by the live total.

**Before/After:**

| Page | Metric | Before | After |
|------|--------|--------|-------|
| /summary | 2026 dividend bar | ~$80,000 | ~$9,200 |
| /dividends/estimations | 2026 projected | Grew from last historical | Anchored to live ~$9,200 |

Issues #408 + #409 closed.

### Theme 5 — Open Follow-Ups

**Worker verification:** `docker exec trading_journal_backend_supabase uv run python -m app.worker.yahoo_refresh_cli` — 297/321 refreshed, 17 skipped, 7 failed. DB self-corrected per PR #410.

**GBP/LSE pence issue (NOT addressed this sprint):** Account 72 (Leumi IRA London-listed holdings: RIO, BARC, NG, NXT, LGEN, etc.) sum to ~5.3M GBP — likely in pence (GBp) not pounds, analogous to the TASE ILA issue. Separate follow-up issue opened.

**Legacy worker container:** `trading_journal_worker` (image `trading-journal-worker`, 28h uptime as of sprint end, throws SSL EOF on `compute_jobs`) runs old code from a separate compose file. `docker stop trading_journal_worker` when convenient; separate follow-up issue opened.

**Held PRs requiring human review:** #393 (Next.js 16) and #244 (ESLint 10) — both major version bumps, await @cohenjo validation.

**Note:** Inbox file `hockney-leumi-parser-2026-05-11.md` was not present in `.squad/decisions/inbox/` at fold time. PR #414 content reconstructed from sprint summary notes.

#### PR #417 — XFLT yield decimal enforcement + worker container rebuild (Hockney)

**SHA:** `4af7f6c` → `main`

**Root cause:** The Docker container `trading_journal_backend_supabase` was running **pre-PR-#413 stale code** — it had never been rebuilt after #413 merged. When the Yahoo worker executed, it fetched `dividendYield` (which returns 14.06 for a 14.06% yield), had no `> 1` normalisation guard, and wrote `14.06` back to the DB, overwriting the migrated `0.1406` values for XFLT and any other percentage-format rows.

**Fix:**
1. Container rebuilt — `docker compose -f docker-compose.backend.yml build --no-cache backend` → new image SHA `33fd12cab77e`. Worker's `raw_float > 1: raw_float /= 100` guard (lines 192–193 of `yahoo_refresh.py`) now live in the running container.
2. DB patched — `UPDATE stock_positions SET dividend_yield = dividend_yield / 100 WHERE dividend_yield > 1` (3 XFLT rows; 0 rows >1 remain post-fix).
3. Post-rebuild refresh run — 297 refreshed; XFLT = `0.140600` ✅.
4. CHECK constraint `chk_dividend_yield_decimal` added via migration `20260512010000_enforce_dividend_yield_decimal.sql`: `CHECK (dividend_yield IS NULL OR (dividend_yield >= 0 AND dividend_yield <= 1))`. Future worker regressions now fail loudly with a constraint violation instead of silently corrupting values.

**Verification:** 622/622 backend tests passing. DB: 0 rows with `dividend_yield > 1`; 281 rows in `[0,1]`.

**Decision/principle reinforced:**
> **Always rebuild containers after worker code changes.** Migrations alone cannot correct values that the stale in-memory worker will overwrite on its next run. Container rebuild must be the final step of any worker code change deployment.
> **Use DB CHECK constraints as defense-in-depth for unit/format invariants.** `stock_positions.dividend_yield` MUST be decimal fraction `[0,1]`. The constraint enforces this at the DB layer — no silent corruption possible.

#### PR #418 — IRA market value composite display fixes (Fenster)

**SHA:** `2f4e009` → `main`

**Root cause:** DB was already correct (LUMI `market_value` = 78,639 ILS post PR #414 migration). Three stacked display-layer bugs caused the UI to inflate IRA values dramatically:

1. **`mark_price` displayed in agorot** — `formatCurrency(mark_price, 'ILA')` rendered the raw agorot value (e.g. `₪7,786`) instead of the ILS per-share price (`₪77.86`). Fix: divide by 100 for ILA in `toDisplayMarkPrice()` in `StockPositionsTable.tsx`.
2. **`market_value` mislabeled with `'ILA'` Intl currency code** — `market_value` is stored in ILS by the DB worker/migration (per PR #410 contract), but passing `currency='ILA'` to `Intl.NumberFormat` displayed it as an agorot amount, creating a confusing unit mismatch. Fix: `toDisplayCurrency()` maps ILA → ILS for all value display contexts.
3. **No ILS→USD conversion in portfolio footer** — `AggregatePortfolioFooter` summed ILA/ILS `market_value`s and passed the sum directly to the USD total with no FX conversion, inflating the IRA account's contribution by ~3×. Fix: `convertCurrency(mv, 'ILS', 'USD')` for ILA positions in `AggregatePortfolioFooter.tsx`.
4. **`market_value_local` not used as fallback** — 7 IRA positions had `market_value=null` (Yahoo worker hasn't mapped their TASE ticker) but valid `market_value_local` set by the Leumi parser. These contributed $0 to totals. Fix: `market_value ?? market_value_local ?? 0` throughout `actions.ts`, `StockPositionsTable.tsx`, and `AggregatePortfolioFooter.tsx`.

**Verification:** Vercel auto-deployed. LUMI: mark price ₪77.86, market value ₪78,639 ILS (~$26k USD). IRA total in portfolio footer: ~$260k USD (was ~$778k). Grand portfolio total correct.

**Decision/principle reinforced:**
> **When DB is correct but UI is wrong, dig into the display layer.** `mark_price` unit (agorot vs ILS), Intl currency code label, FX conversion in aggregators, and `market_value_local` fallback are all separate axes — migrations that fix DB storage do not automatically fix display bugs.
> **Composite display bugs stack multiplicatively.** `mark_price` ÷100 error + ILA/ILS label mismatch + missing FX conversion produced a combined ~100–300× inflation of IRA displayed values.
